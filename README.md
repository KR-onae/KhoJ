Korean KRonae made KhoJ!

# What? What's this?
KhoJ is the Minecraft plugin development helper!

# Then... How to use?
First, use the following code to start using KhoJ:
```java
KhoJ.setup(Bukkit.getPluginManager(), this);
```
This use at creating an inventory, and you must write when you set up a click or close event using AddEventListener.
In general, it should be written at the top of the 'onEnable' method of your plugin.
